These properties empower key use-cases like Industry 4.0, Vehicular Communication and Internet of Things. Nowadays implementation of Edge computing is based on extensions to available Cloud computing software tools. While this approach accelerates adoption, it hinders the deployment of the aforementioned use-cases that requires an infrastructure largely more decentralized than Cloud data centers, notably in the far-Edge of the network. In this context, this work aims at: (i) analyzing the differences between Cloud and Edge infrastructures, (ii) analyzing the architecture adopted by the most prominent open-source Edge computing solutions, and (iii) evaluating those solutions in terms of scalability and service instantiation time in a medium-size far Edge system. Results show that mainstream Edge solutions require powerful centralized controllers and always-on connectivity, making them unsuitable for highly decentralized scenarios in the far-Edge where stable and high-bandwidth links are not ubiquitous.},

They have strong security and safety constraints and are at the crossroad of several domains, thus leading to as many independent components. Plus, as foreseen by the Vehicle to Everything paradigm, Autonomous Vehicles are expected to interact with their surroundings, again increasing their overall complexity. To cope with these requirements, frameworks based on dataflow programming are emerging. Indeed, dataflow programming is particularly suited in this context as it is already being used in robotics and time-critical applications. However, it was not designed with decentralization in mind, hence leaving all communication-related aspects to application developers. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage Eclipse Zenoh, an Edge-native technology. For that purpose, we first show how we used Zenoh to enhance ERDOS, a dataflow framework for Autonomous Vehicles. We then motivate and draft our own dataflow framework based on Zenoh: Zenoh Flow.},

  abstract = {Robotic systems are typically subject to real-time constraints. Still, the ROS ecosystem-the most popular repository of open-source robotics software-exhibits little evidence of the use of real-time theory to bound or control worst-case response times. Hurdles to adoption are the amount of expertise required to correctly use real-time scheduling mechanisms and the inherent unpredictability of typical robotics workloads, which defy static provisioning. To overcome these hurdles, ROS-Llama, an automatic latency manager for ROS2, is proposed. Crucially, use of ROS-Llama requires only little effort and knowledge of realtime concepts. Relevant properties of ROS2 and essential requirements of the robotics domain are identified, and the conceptual and practical challenges in developing such a mostly automatic tool are discussed. Experiments on a mobile robot demonstrate the viability of the approach and show that ROS-Llama reduces the maximum observed latency under load compared to the default Linux scheduler. Finally, open problems in the underlying real-time analysis and major platform limitations in Linux and ROS2 that prevent further improvements are identified.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the following relevant wireless technologies: IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4-oriented, and Sub-GHz-based LoRa. Our goal is to highlight how various communication technologies may be suitable for mesh networking, either providing a native support or being adapted subsequently. Hence, we discuss how these wireless technologies, being either standard or proprietary, can adapt to IoT scenarios (e.g., smart cities and smart agriculture) in which the heterogeneity of the involved devices is a key feature.

  abstract = {In the mathematical area of graph theory, a clique ( or ) is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. That is, a clique of a graph                         G                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle G\}    is an induced subgraph of                         G                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle G\}    that is complete. Cliques are one of the basic concepts of graph theory and are used in many other mathematical problems and constructions on graphs. Cliques have also been studied in computer science: the task of finding whether there is a clique of a given size in a graph (the clique problem) is NP-complete, but despite this hardness result, many algorithms for finding cliques have been studied. Although the study of complete subgraphs goes back at least to the graph-theoretic reformulation of Ramsey theory by Erd\H{o}s \& Szekeres (1935), the term clique comes from Luce \& Perry (1949), who used complete subgraphs in social networks to model cliques of people; that is, groups of people all of whom know each other. Cliques have many other applications in the sciences and particularly in bioinformatics.},

Results show that, in the case of an exemplary delivery application comprising two mobile robots, the robot coordination and range can be improved by consuming real-time radio information available at the edge.

Robotics is one of the areas that have benefited a lot from these advancements. Many important and useful applications for single-robot and multi-robot systems (MRS) have emerged. Such applications include search and rescue, detection of forest fires, mining, construction, disaster management, and many more. MRS systems greatly enhance the capabilities and effectiveness of today's robots. They extend the robotic system capabilities by increasing the ability to perform more complex tasks and allow performance of inherently distributed ones. In addition, they increase parallelism, enhance robustness, and improve system reliability. However, to perform their tasks in an effective manner, communication between the individual robots becomes an essential component. In this paper, we discuss the various types and architectures of MRS systems and focus on the networking issues, and services that are required to enable MRS systems to be more efficient in performing their roles in their respective applications. We also identify the similarities and differences between mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and MRS systems, analyze robot-to-robot (R2R) and robot-to-infrastructure (R2I) communication links, and identify the protocols that can be used at the various levels in the MRS hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Middleware for robotics development must meet demanding requirements in real-time distributed embedded systems. The Robot Operating System (ROS), open-source middleware, has been widely used for robotics applications. However, the ROS is not suitable for real-time embedded systems because it does not satisfy real-time requirements and only runs on a few OSs. To address this problem, ROS1 will undergo a significant upgrade to ROS2 by utilizing the Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is suitable for real-time distributed embedded systems due to its various transport configurations (e.g., deadline and fault-tolerance) and scalability. ROS2 must convert data for DDS and abstract DDS from its users; however, this incurs additional overhead, which is examined in this study. Transport latencies between ROS2 nodes vary depending on the use cases, data size, configurations, and DDS vendors. We conduct proof of concept for DDS approach to ROS and arrange DDS characteristic and guidelines from various evaluations. By highlighting the DDS capabilities, we explore and evaluate the potential and constraints of DDS and ROS2.},

  abstract = {Cloud Computing is a model of service delivery and access where dynamically scalable and virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet. This model creates a new horizon of opportunity for enterprises. It introduces new operating and business models that allow customers to pay for the resources they effectively use, instead of making heavy upfront investments. The biggest challenge in Cloud Computing is the lack of a de facto standard or single architectural method, which can meet the requirements of an enterprise cloud approach. In this paper, we explore the architectural features of Cloud Computing and classify them according to the requirements of end-users, enterprises that use the cloud as a platform, and cloud providers themselves. We show that several architectural features will play a major role in the adoption of the Cloud Computing paradigm as a mainstream commodity in the enterprise world. This paper also provides key guidelines to software architects and Cloud Computing application developers for creating future architectures.},
